<h1>BO2 Error Tracker</h1>

<p>I made this tool mainly to create something better looking, props to <a href=https://github.com/lveez><b>Iveez</b></a> who made it first, mine's a reflex of it, <a href=https://github.com/lveez/BO2-ERROR-TRACKER><b>link to the original one if you want to try it out.</b></a></p>
<p>It's missing a few things:</p>

* parent_size: I couldn't understand how to get this value so it's reflecting parent_next
* Same goes to child_size and xAnimInfo_size, reflecting child_next and xAnimInfo_next
* com_frametime is going crazy, so i've created a third timer with 500ms, less than this wouldn't work properly
